For my fathers birthday this year I created a model of my family crest and had it printed in 3D by Shapeways. The final model arrived the other day and I'm pretty pleased with how it looks. Unfortunately I only have a point and shoot camera with fairly limited macro capabilities, so the photos don't look that great, but I include a Vray render to show the details too.
