For my fathers birthday this year I created a model of my family crest and had it printed in 3D by Shapeways. The final model arrived the other day and I'm pretty pleased with how it looks. Unfortunately I only have a point and shoot camera with fairly limited macro capabilities, so the photos don't look that great, but I include a Vray render to show the details too.

> That is really amazing what you did with the Family crest.
> I have been searching for an image of the crest but all that I find looks too generic. The one you have is the best one so far. If possible can you E-mail me the Image that you designed this off of.
