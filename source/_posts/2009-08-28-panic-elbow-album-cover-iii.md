The third piece of album art I've produced for Panic Elbow, and probably my favourite. This one was inspired by an [alchemy](http://al.chemy.org) sketch I did whilst listening to one of their songs - it had a darker feel than their other music, and obviously given the name, I thought it made a fitting accompaniment.

As usual, I encourage you to go and listen to their music on their [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/panicelbow).
