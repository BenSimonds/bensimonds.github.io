> Thanks!  The retopo tool was what I was looking for.  Too bad retopo is not available for 3D bezier curves.

> I used two techniques for the different parts. The first was the retopo tool, which you can find in the Mesh panel of the edit buttons. The second was a lattice method. for which you add a lattice object to the scene and then apply a lattice modifier to the object you want to distort and set the lattice as the target object. Hope that helps!

> How did you "project" the hair pattern onto the curved head surface (at 2:08 in the video)?  I have been trying to find this feature, but no success.  Thanks
> P.S.  Impressive modeling!
