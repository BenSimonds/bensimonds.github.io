Testing out the rig and shapekeys for a face I made. [vimeo http://vimeo.com/23076748]  Originally sculpted in zbrush, retopologised and rigged in blender.

> Yeah it would work with sculptris as well. I do bake some maps with ZB, but you can do it in blender too. I basically just import a mid-res obj to do the retopo, and then if you want to bake maps too then import a high res obj to bake from (as high as you can handle in blender on your machine).

> Great man, congrats!!!! Did you use bones or shape keys?

Ben Simonds (Apr 30, 2011)
> About 90% shape keys, only the eye tracking and the overall head movement uses bones.

> Wow, this is very cool !
> How long did you spend for creating and setting up all these shape keys.

> This looks like an insane amount of work :)

> How many shape keys are used in this rig ?

Ben Simonds (May 01, 2011)
> It took a couple of days, though she isn't finshed yet. She has 48 shapekeys so far, though some are simply mirror duplicates of one another.

> Very clever and minimal yet very effective rig, Ben! This is simply genius.  It's just so nice to see those shape keys in action and in unison.

> Thanks. I definitely want to give some dialogue a try.

> great stuff. idiot question, that frame with all the sliders in the upper right corner, where is that or did you create that?

Ben Simonds (May 08, 2011)
> I made it using boneshapes. I just made it as a mesh and then assigned it as a shape for the master bone that all the sliders get parented to.

> Very impressive! Quick question for you on your workflow from Zbrush to Blender. I see you retopo in Blender. Could this also be accomplished w/ a Sculptris and Blender combo? If your not familiar w/ Sculptirs, can you give a brief sentence or 2 on you method? Thanks for displaying your work
