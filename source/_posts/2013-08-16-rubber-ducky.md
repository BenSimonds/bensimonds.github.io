[![Rubber Ducky](/images/old/rubberducky.png)](/images/old/rubberducky.png)   This fella was just a very quick little model I made for a larger project, but I kinda liked him and wanted to share him, so I stuck him up on blendswap, with a CC-0 licence. He's ready to go if you're rendering in cycles. Hope you like him! [ Rubber Ducky on Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/69732)
