http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=XfezG5M2ICg Project Gooseberry has finally launched, and Gecko Animation is on board! We're teaming up with the Blender Foundation and 11 other studios across the world to produce the world's first open source feature film. Over the course of about 18 months, we'll be putting together one part of a film about a sheep named Michel, who longs for a more exciting and interesting life. Directed by [Mathieu Auvray](http://mathieu-auvray.tumblr.com/), and overseen by the Blender Foundation, at Gecko we will be working with art director Jonathan Ball (Poked Studio) to create a weird, silly addition to the worlds that the film will take you through. [![RenderCompBeautify0131](/images/old/rendercompbeautify0131.jpg)](/images/old/rendercompbeautify0131.jpg) The project is currently seeking crowd funding, and we need 10,000 people to help change film history by making the worlds first open source feature film possible. In return, you'll receive unprecedented access to the film's production, as well as a whole bunch of extras. By signing up for the Blender Cloud, you'll get unparalleled access to all of the Blender Institutes digital resources (including training material and assets from previous films), as well as production data from the Gooseberry Project as the film is made. You can learn more about the project at [gooseberry.blender.org](http://gooseberry.blender.org/). Go sign up for a membership or a make a one-off donation and help make this movie happen!
