I've started doing some anatomy practice based on the idea outlined at the [Art of Anatomy forums](http://www.theartofanatomy.com/), to try and improve my anatomy knowledge. The aim is to study each part of the body piece by piece, and I've started with the feet. **Exercise** **One: Ref hunt and label anatomical landmarks.**

**Exercise Two: Draw from reference.**
