I've started doing some anatomy practice based on the idea outlined at the [Art of Anatomy forums](http://www.theartofanatomy.com/), to try and improve my anatomy knowledge. The aim is to study each part of the body piece by piece, and I've started with the feet. **Exercise** **One: Ref hunt and label anatomical landmarks.**

**Exercise Two: Draw from reference.**

**Exercise Three: Draw from memory.**

**Exercise Four: Sculpt**

> wow really great! did you sculpt that broken rock type thing above the ankle?

Ben Simonds (Jul 02, 2011)
> Yup, mostly clay brushes and a little hard surface polish plus some procedural noise.

> Great stuff.  I'm assuming you just rigged your foot and put in different positions for that final shot?

Ben Simonds (Jul 02, 2011)
> Thanks. I just posed it in zbrush actually, with the transpose tool. That way I could sculpt in some creases too.

> Blender isn't really to graphics card heavy. I use a GeForce 9800 1GB card at the moment. For sculpting (as with most other aspects of blender RAM is really the most usefull thing to have a lot of.

> Hello. I apologize for my English. What video card do you use on your computer to work with blender? I pick up the video card for my workstation and I want the best results in the mode of sculpting.
