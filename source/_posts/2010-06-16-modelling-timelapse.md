 Modelling a head in Blender. This video covers me modelling the head poly-by-poly and then doing some low-detail sculpting to fill out the forms. The basic modelling was done in Blender 2.49, and I switched to JWilkins' Google summer of code sculpt build for the sculpting, so I could play with the new tools. In particular I think the improved clay brush and the scrape and fill tools are brilliant, and well worth seeking out a build yourself if you're into sculpting. You can find a recent build at [graphicall.org](http://graphicall.org), just look for a JWilkins GSoC build appropriate to your OS.

Hopefully I will find time to follow this one up with a timelapse of some higher detail sculpting and maybe texturing at a later date.
