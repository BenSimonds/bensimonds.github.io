The models I made for the CGTalk "Icons of Sci-Fi" HMC. I didn't actually get around to finishing them on time for the challenge, but they were fun to do. The Hitchhikers Guide has always been my favourite Sci-Fi series, and I've listened to the radio shows more times than I can comfortably comprehend. The movie was a really fun adaptation of the series too, and in particular I think they nailed the look of the characters and the world... er... galaxy.

Marvin was modelled mostly in blender, Arthur mostly in zbrush. Rendered in V-Ray and postwork in Blender/GIMP. I might find time to texture Arthur at a later date, but for now I'm leaving them as a clay render.
