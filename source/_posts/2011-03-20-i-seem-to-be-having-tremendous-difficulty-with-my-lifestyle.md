> U are really good artist and very nice sculpting in Zbrush. Can u advice me some good tutorial for Zbrush? Many peoples said, that its really user-friendly but i dont think so, the zooming is really wierd. Hold Alt + Right click, it takes so much time.

> Still in development yes. But very much functional at this stage. I'm using v-ray standalone, which is basically v-ray for maya, without the maya bit (which makes it much cheaper, which is nice).

> V-Ray / Blender is still in development no? And if u are using v-ray, it must be v-ray for maya right?

> I dont think I have the file handy any more, but I think it was a pretty simple setup - a couple of big area lamps, and just a simple orange plastic type material on arthur and marvin. For the cavity-type effect I just took an AO pass and used it as a mask for reducing the saturation and tweaking the hue a bit in the crevices. Hope that helps!
