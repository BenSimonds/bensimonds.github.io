> Super handy. I just started learning recently and it's such a timesaver. Try the non-programmers guide to python (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3) for a good intro if you're interested in learning. It's good to get your head around just regular python a little before jumping into bpy.

> Great tips!  Its nice to make simple tools in rigging too.   Full-featured, end-to-end rigging has its drawbacks.
