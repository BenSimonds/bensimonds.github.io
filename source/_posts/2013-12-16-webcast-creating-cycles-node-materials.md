Last week I did a live webcast presentation for O'Reilly, where I talked about tips and tricks for creating cycles node materials. I covered different ways of working with node groups, tips for using vertex paint in your materials, as well as how the Light Paths node works and how it can be used for creating different kinds of glass shaders. I also had a nice Q&A with the live audience at the end. [You can find the webcast in its original format here.](http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2808)
