You can find one of my most recent tutorials in the current issue of 3DArtist magazine, which is out now. The article takes you through creating a fantasy castle built on a forest covered mountain in Blender. [Here's a link to the newspost ](http://www.3dartistonline.com/news/2014/11/buy-3d-artist-issue-74-today/)on Issue 74, where you can see what else is in store for that issue as well. You can buy a copy on the[ Imagine Publishing Store.](https://www.imagineshop.co.uk/magazines/3dartist/3d-artist-issue-74.html) Here's a look at the final product:
