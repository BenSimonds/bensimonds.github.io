Blender at Campus Party, London | BlenderNation (Sep 10, 2013)
> [&#8230;] On Friday last week (the 6th) Jonathan Lax and I gave a talk at Campus Party on modelling with blender, plus a workshop in the afternoon. Campus Party is a big tech convention, which was held this year at the O2, which used to be the Millennium Dome; a huge tent-like building built for the millennium, and these days is usually a venue for big music concerts and performances, so it was pretty exciting talking about Blender at such a famous venue. The talk was on the sorts of things you can do with blender and the new modelling and sculpting tools that have been added to blender in recent years. For the workshop we introduced people to blenders texturing and sculpting tools, using a simple character that everyone could customise in their own way. You can find a few more on my post about the day on my website. [&#8230;]
