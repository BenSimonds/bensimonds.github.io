Something that gives a lot of people trouble when creating characters is
implementing convincing subsurface scattering (SSS). Blender's SSS shader
comes with a wealth of options that make it easy to customise how light
scatters under a surface, but also makes it tough to hit on what options
exactly make for convincing skin. Using a node based approach, one can create
a three layer SSS shader that gives good, and reasonably physically correct
results, and also makes making adjustments fairly straightforward. in this
tutorial I use blender 2.5, but I used almost the exact same setup for my
blending life entry in 2.49 and got much the same results (just without such
fast ray-tracing, thanks blender devs!).  **The Basics:** A three layer SSS
shader emulates skin by splitting the effect of the different layers of skin
into different materials: 

[![](/images/old/sums.jpg)](/images/old/sums.jpg)


These are added together in the material node editor, primarily using screen
nodes (UPDATE: or add nodes, see my note at the end) so that the light from
each layer is added to that of the layer below, resulting in the final
composite material. Click for full size: [![Click for full
size.](/images/old/nodesetup.jpg)](/images/old/nodesetup.jpg) **Important SSS
Settings:**

**![](/images/old/ssssettings.jpg)**

_IOR:_ Index of refraction - this is the same as the IOR for raytraced
reflection and refraction, and reflects the IOR of the medium. As people are
about 60% water, and the IOR of water is 1.3, this is a suitable value to use.
_Scale:_ This is the big one. This is really important to get right as it will
determine how far light scatters through the skin, and is the difference
between looking like wax and getting nice skin. A scale of 1.0 means that one
blender unit equals one millimeter - this is obviously way too large for most
scenes. The average head is around 20 to 25cm tall, which would mean that if
you scaled your head to exactly one blender unit high, that a value of 0.004
would give correct results. In general you may want to try a bit of tweaking
to get the right results. Adjust accordingly for the size of your model
according to this formula: size in blender units/real world size in
millimeters = scale value. _RGB radius:_ This allows you to set the relative
scattering amounts for red green and blue light, in proportion to the scale
value. This is important for skin as different colours of light scatter by
different amounts under the skin. As a good rule of thumb, red light scatters
the most, green light half as much as red, and blue light half as much again.
So values of 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 for red green and blue respectively should give
good results. _Colour:_ Colour influence. This controls how much the RGB
colour picker in the SSS setttings affects the scattering, as a rule I
generally set the colour to a dark grey to tone down the effect, and the
colour value to 0. This is because we want the colour of the scattered light
to be determined by our textures, not a generic colour all over the model. Not
that even with the colour slider set to zero the, the colour you choose in the
picker above will still affect the scattering. _Texture:_ This is another
important one. It's more of a personal preference than the others, as this
setting determines how much your textures are blurred by the scattering,
higher values will blur the texture more. I prefer to leave this set to zero,
as I like my textures to look crisp and I feel that this washes out the
detail, particularly in the lower layers like the subdermal, but feel free to
experiment. _Scattering Weight:_ These determine the relative amounts of
scattering from the front and back of the model. Because we are splitting up
our three layer shader to isolate these effects, for the subdermal and
epidermal material set front to 1.0 and back to 0.0. and for the back scatter
material set back to 1.0 and front to 0.0. For further explanation of these
settings, check the blender
[documentation](http://www.blender.org/development/release-
logs/blender-244/subsurface-scattering/). **Subdermal:** You will note, that
there are in fact more than three nodes. The three layers refer to the three
different material nodes that use subsurface scattering. The first - the
subdermal layer - simulates the light that penetrates to the deep layers of
the skin, and spreads out the furthest. This light gets mostly absorbed by the
skin, and only the deep red/orange colours of the blood and tissues are re-
emitted. This is the most important layer for giving the material those rich
saturated shadows that we see in natural skin. This is also the layer with the
most important textures - as the subtle patterns of veins and capillaries,
fatty tissues and bony areas beneath the skin are what give it much of it's
realism. 

[![](/images/old/subdermal.jpg)](/images/old/subdermal.jpg)

 Settings:
This layer is the most translucent, so I give it a slightly higher scale value
to increase the scattering distance. In theory this isn't quite correct as the
scale should be the same for all the layers. However in practice it is easier
just to adjust the scale value, though you can also tweak the RGB scattering
radii separately. Apart from that this layer is very simple. The subdermal
texure is applied by means of a texture node mapped to the colour channel of
the material node, using th UV output of the geometry node to correctly map
the texture. No bump map is needed in my opinion as this layer is technically
below the surface of the skin anyway, but if you are using a normal map to add
mid-level detail such as creases and wrinkles, then that can be applied to
this material.


[![](/images/old/subdermal_settings1.jpg)](/images/old/subdermal_settings1.jpg)


ï»¿ **Epidermal:** This layer simulates the scatttering in the thinner epidermal
layers of skin. The light that gets reflected from this layer has a more
blueish tinge. The thickness of this layer varies widely - in areas like the
eyelids and lips it is much thinner and so more of the subdermal layer shows
through. This is reflected in the texture by colouring these areas more
darkly. Because this is added to the subdermal layer by means of a screen
node, darker areas on the texture mean that less is added on top of the sub
dermal layer, allowing the redder subdermal colours to show through more.


[![](/images/old/epidermal.jpg)](/images/old/epidermal.jpg)

 Settings: Another
fairly simple material, the epidermal colour texture is mapped via a texture
node as before. The scale value is set slightly lower, as light scatters less
within this layer. This time as the epidermal layer is a surface layer, you
may want to apply a bump map.


[![](/images/old/epidermal_settings.jpg)](/images/old/epidermal_settings.jpg)


**Back Scatter:** In areas such as the ears where the skin protrudes from the
face (and other areas on the body like the gaps between the fingers), light
may shine through the skin from the far side, giving it a reddish glow. In
order to be able to tweak this effect separately, we isolate it from the other
SSS materials by turning their back scatter values down to zero, and instead
use a separate back scatter material node to control this aspect of the skin
individually. This material does not really require a texture, as the colour
is determined largely by the thickness of the skin the light has to shine
through. This is a more subtle part of the material, and indeed may not be
visible at all in many well lit environments. It tends to be most obvious when
the subject is lit from behind.



[![](/images/old/backscatter1.jpg)](/images/old/backscatter1.jpg)



Settings: This is a really simple material. no textures, just a basic SSS
shader with only back scattering. Unlike the other materials, here we use set
the colour setting in the SSS panel to one. Set the scale value quite large,
as this layer is for light scattering all the way through the skin (Again: I
know this isn't physically correct, but it a nice easy way to tweak the
result).



[![](/images/old/backscatter_settings.jpg)](/images/old/backscatter_settings.jpg)



**Diffuse:** **** This material consists of the simple, diffuse reflected
light from the skin, rather than that which is absorbed within the skin and
re-emitted (so no SSS is required for this material). If you were to imagine a
plaster of paris mask of the person, this is all the light you would see
reflected (apart from specular reflections, which we will come to in a
minute). This layer can be used to tweak the colours of the skin, to add
pigmentation or makeup, and to "fix" any areas you don't like. Unlike the
other layers you can experiment with different mix modes in the node editor to
get different effects - you could keep it to a simple screen mode to just add
a bit of diffuse light, or set the mode to mix to allow you to add darker
colours as well.



[![](/images/old/diffuse.jpg)](/images/old/diffuse.jpg)



****

Settings: This is just a super-simple Lambert diffuse shader, no specular, no
SSS. Incidentally, this makes it an ideal material just for checking out how
your lighting looks without having to wait ages for a full SSS render, just
plug the output from this material node directly into the output node in the
material node editor to see how your model looks without textures and shaders
applied. This can be really useful when trying to troubleshoot renders that
don't look right.



[![](/images/old/diffusesettings1.jpg)](/images/old/diffusesettings1.jpg)



**Specular:**

This layer is for the shiny reflections (both specular and mirror reflections,
an artificial distinction in reality). The diffuse colour for this material is
matte black, with reflection set to zero, as we only want specular and mirror
reflections from this material. The shinyness of the skin varies over the
face, with more oily areas such as the forehead, brows, and the bridge of the
nose, and wet areas like the lips and around the eyelids reflecting more. We
can control this by using a specular map - darker areas on the map reflect
less, and the bright areas such as the lips and nose will give nice shiny
reflections. 

[![](/images/old/specular.jpg)](/images/old/specular.jpg)

 This
texture is mapped to the specular intensity and ray mirror (if you are using
ray tracing) channels, set the blend mode to multiply to allow you to to
control the maximum specularity using the materials settings, and the relative
specularity of the different areas of the skin with the texture. In my node
setup, I actï»¿ually blend two specular materials together, one with a high
hardness (around 90) and no ray mirror for the small "hot" highlights, and one
with a low hardness (down around 30) and mirror reflections to give a more
general spread out shine to the skin. The same specular texture is applied to
each and they are added together with a screen node.


[![](/images/old/spec_settings.jpg)](/images/old/spec_settings.jpg)

**Other
textures:** The only other texture required is the bump map, which I mention
above should be applied to the epidermal, diffuse and specular materials to
give the surface some detail. Also if you have a normal map texture (for
example baked from a high res sculpt, or if you simply prefer normal maps to
bump mapping) then this should definitely be applied to the surface layers
(diffuse, epidermal, specular), and potentially to the subdermal layer too
depending on what level of detail is present in it.


[![](/images/old/bumpnor.jpg)](/images/old/bumpnor.jpg)

 **Acknowledgements:**
A lot of what I know about SSS I learned from Maqs and Pixelvore on the
blender artists forums. In particular Maqs' SSS shader tests are brilliant,
and whilst a lot of the links are broken now, his
[thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=145904&page=9) is an
excellent source of information. **Questions?** If you have any more
questions, leave them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. **Add vs.
Screen Nodes:** [Francois Tarlier](http://www.francois-tarlier.com/blog/)
points out that if you are working with blenders colour management turned on,
then you should use add mode to mix the materials rather than screen. This is
because screen is sort of a cheat for working with un-gamma corrected
textures. I originally made this shader using 2.49 for my blending life entry,
and as 2.49 doesn't have a nice way of gamma correcting textures (and I'm too
lazy to do it in GIMP) I found screen worked better. With 2.5s new colour
management I agree with Francois that add mode is more correct. Here is a bit
of a comparison for those interested:
[](http://bensimonds.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/final_comparison.jpg)

[![](/images/old/final_comparison1.jpg)](/images/old/final_comparison1.jpg)


On the left we have a colour management turned off, but a gamma correction of
0.45 (1/2.2) applied in the compositor in post, and screen nodes used to
combine the materials. On the right we have add nodes use, and colour
management turned on. I think the latter looks a bit better. It's a bit of a
false test though - I usually end up doing a fair bit of adjustment in the
compositor in post anyways (I even did a quick brightness and contrast
adjustment to both of these in the GIMP, though the exact same correction was
applied to both) to get a render looking how I want. Neither looks like I
would want straight out of the box. **Blendfile:** If you want a blend file to
get you started, a pared down version of the shader used for this tutorial is
avaliable at
[blendswap.com](http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/materials/bens-three-layer-
sss/). However, be aware that this is just the basic shader, and proper
textures are a must for good results.

As far as add vs screen is concerned I've tried both and I find screen works better, that's all. I prefer it because it seems to prevent the values topping out too soon.

bensimonds (Jun 01, 2010)

bensimonds (Jun 01, 2010)
> They don't look quite right, as I say I would normally do more post work to get the effect I want. What it does show however is that the colour management version with add nodes maintains richer colours and deeper shadows when done correctly vs the non-colour managed version. Something previously I had to spend time fixing in the compositor.

francoisgfx (Jun 01, 2010)
> yes I understand, blacks are usually a bit more tedious to work with. But still in your comparison I prefer the redish skin with Add &amp; CM. This is great, because I never did the test before to compare both, I just know theoretically it is supposed to be like that (on a physic &amp; math base at least), but never did the try.

bensimonds (Jun 03, 2010)
> It is a hand painted map, - the main areas to think about are those extra shiny parts like the lips and the bridge of the nose. It's actually one of the easier maps to paint. You can also start off using your bump or diffuse map as a base. if you invert it and take the brightness down low it makes quite a good starting point for laying out the shinier areas.

On the other hand if your model is quite low poly and the normal map adds definition to some major areas of light and shadow in the final render, then it should be applied to all the layers to get better results.

Ben Simonds (Dec 02, 2011)
> Good question. This was something that gave me trouble a while ago. For darker skin, it's less easy to rely on adding together layers - as it can get difficult to tweak. An alternative would be to use mix nodes for the epidermal and diffuse layers and only add the specular and subdermal layers, this would allow you to mix in the dark tones from the upper layers of the skin. Another (simpler) option would be to use a single layer shader and just add your SSS that way.

> Wow, fantastic work here! I've been trying to do something similar for the Cycles render engine, considering that it now has a Subsurface Scattering Shader. The only issue is that the front and back scattering values can't seem to be set.
> Do you have any idea of how to do something similar in Cycles, at all?
