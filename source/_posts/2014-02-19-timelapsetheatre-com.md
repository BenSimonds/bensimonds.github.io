*2022 Update*: Timelapse theatre is no longer live.

[TimelapseTheatre.com](https://www.timelapsetheatre.com/) is a recent side project of ours at Gecko Animation. [@Laxy](https://twitter.com/laxy) is a talented photographer and has spent much of this winter freezing his arse off at various locations around London and further afield in England, and has produced a fantastic collection of time-lapse footage. Meanwhile I've been working on the back end for processing all of the clips (using blender of course), allowing us to produce high-quality videos in a variety of formats. [Jack McConnell ](https://twitter.com/jackmcconnell)of [Voltronik](http://www.voltronik.co.uk/) has done a terrific job on the site design.

At TimelapseTheatre.com you will find:

  * A wide (and expanding) range of time-lapse clips, all super-high quality, available for purchase.
  * Resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160).
  * A variety of frame rates to suit your region (PAL, NTFS, and even silky smooth 60 FPS).

We're very proud of what we've got to offer, so please go [take a look](https://www.timelapsetheatre.com/)!
