 This was a major project of mine. I worked on it for a couple of months on and off in all. There is a [WIP thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=140480) over at blenderArtists.org on it's progress. There's also an OpenGL rendered flythrough tour, showing a bit more detail.

 In addition I produced a short tutorial on making ships in blender. See the pages link above labelled HMS Victory model tutorial, or click [here](http://bensimonds.wordpress.com/hms-victory-model-tutorial/).

> Unfortunately the model itself is not avaliable for download. The files are far too big for me to host anywhere. If you need any specifics though drop me another comment and I'll see if I have any renders that could help you out.

> Hi, could I by any chance use the textures you used here on a project of mine? You'll receive full credit of course! I've tried making my own, and succeeded sort-of, but it just doesn't look right. It would be a real help to base my skin on your textures. Could I get them?

> Most of the textures I used are freely available at cgtextures.com, but I put a few of my more edited ones in a zip for you: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/180363/Victory_textures.zip

> Thanks a lot! Especially like the red and blue (the textures are going to be used in a game... Always red vs. blue!)

> Sorry to bother you again, the skin for the ship itself is done, the deck and masts are giving me some problems though... Got anything I could use?

> Could you PLEASE put this on BlendSwap? You can compress it for smaller file size.
