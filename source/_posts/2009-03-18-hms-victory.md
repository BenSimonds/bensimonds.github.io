Finally got out a decent rendered turntable of my HMS victory model, so here it is:

This was a major project of mine. I worked on it for a couple of months on and off in all. There is a [WIP thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=140480) over at blenderArtists.org on it's progress. There's also an OpenGL rendered flythrough tour, showing a bit more detail.

In addition I produced a short tutorial on making ships in blender. See the pages link above labelled HMS Victory model tutorial, or click [here](http://bensimonds.wordpress.com/hms-victory-model-tutorial/).
