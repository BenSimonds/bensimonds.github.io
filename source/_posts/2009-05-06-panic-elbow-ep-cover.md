A friend of mine asked me to do the EP cover for his band, Panic Elbow. He gave me pretty much free reign over what to do with it artistically, so I decided to go down a slightly surrealist route, and came up with this. Check out Panic Elbows music on their [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/panicelbow)!
