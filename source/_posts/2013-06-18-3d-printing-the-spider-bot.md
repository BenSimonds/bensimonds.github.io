3D Modeling | Runes in the Sand (Dec 17, 2013)
> [&#8230;] It looks as though Blender can do way more than I&#8217;ll ever need as far as 3D modeling goes but can it be used in 3D printing? What what I&#8217;ve found so far is that Blender does support the base file format called STL. There is a file standard, used in 3D printing, called Additive Manufacturing File Format (AMF) that Blender doesn&#8217;t seem to currently support. It looks like it may be possible to export a Blender file to this format using a third party add-on. Since the file format requires vary among printers I&#8217;m not too worried that any work I do in Blender can&#8217;t be utilized for printing. If Blender can&#8217;t natively support the requirements of a given project, then there is likely a way to import it into another program that can convert the model into a useful format. Here&#8217;s a item that described what this person went through to convert his Blender model into a 3D printed object. [&#8230;]
