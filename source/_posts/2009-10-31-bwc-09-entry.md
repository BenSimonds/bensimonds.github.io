Here is my entry for the 2009 Blender World Cup. The theme was "Another
World". I came up with a crashed fighter pilot marooned on a strange jungle
planet, inhabited by giant bugs. It's pretty busy, so view full size to take
it all in.

Update: My entry won the spot prize for best modelling. I'm really happy about
this as I think it reflects the elements I did best on. Next year I'll focus
on other areas, to try and up my game and take one of the top prizes.
