Today the [Durian](http://durian.blender.org/) open movie guys had a
[modelling sprint](http://durian.blender.org/news/sprint-asset-list-and-new-
rules/), to help flesh out their asset lists for the upcoming Sintel short
film. There was a HUGE amount of participation and director Colin Levy
livestreamed his feedback from Durian HQ. I produced a couple of models, and I
can't wait to see if they appear in the final film.
