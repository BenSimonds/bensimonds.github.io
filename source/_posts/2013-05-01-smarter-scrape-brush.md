 (Apologies for the crappy audio.) A quick mini tutorial on a couple of sculpt brush settings I came up with. They work quite nicely for refining planes quickly when sculpting both hard and soft surfaces, and can be used to quickly refine sharp planes and to smooth transitions between surfaces.

 I made two versions: one that works a scrape brush, and one that works as a fill brush. Both are pretty useful. You can[ download a blend containing the brushes](http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/67891), called **Trim Scrape** and **Trim Fill** from ****[Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com/) . Alternatively if you just want to make them yourselves you can see the relevant settings highlighted below. The key to how the brush works is having a nice hard-edged falloff on the brushe's curve, and making use of autosmooth. So far I've been messing about with them doing some dynamic topology sculpting and they work pretty nicely. Hope you find them useful!

 Edit: My friend and occasional collaborator on [Mountain of Minutes](http://mountainofminutes.wordpress.com/), [Roberto Roch](https://twitter.com/roberto_roch), did a couple of really neat speed-sculpts using this brush, which I thought I'd share here too.
