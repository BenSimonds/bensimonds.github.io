Dyntopo/Trim Brush Test | Mountain of Minutes (May 14, 2013)
> [&#8230;] time no post! This is just a sculpt I did as a quick test of the new dyntopo tools and a sculpting brush I came up with that works rather nicely for refining planes early on in a sculpt. I also slapped a new cycles SSS [&#8230;]

> Sure thing Robert, you can append these brushes into your default blendfile to have them permanently avaliable. Just load the default blend file, then hit File&gt;Append, select the brush blend file, select brushes, and shift-select the two Trim brushes inside. Click Link/Append from Library, and the brushes will now be avaliable. Then just save your startup file (Ctrl-U) to update the default .blend file.
