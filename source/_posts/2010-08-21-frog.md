I like this little guy. Sculpted it today and painted the textures pretty much 90% in blenders texture paint mode. Usually I'd faff around in GIMP with lots of photos, but I was in the mood for some hand painting. I did use a couple of photo textures just as masks for painting over, but mainly it was done just with a regular round brush. As I'd had to do a retopo to recover from blender losing some of the multi-res data (oh the joys of development builds!) I had a nice low res baked mesh anyway, so I thought I'de render it in the Game engine. The image below is pretty much what I was getting in real time with the game engine, just with a litte DoF and bloom added in post.

Here is the high res sculpt (about 2.8M polys): [![](/images/old/wip2.jpg)](/images/old/wip2.jpg) And a WIP shot of the texturing process: [![](/images/old/wip3.jpg)](/images/old/wip3.jpg)

> Blender does not yet have proper, paintable, editable masks for edit mode, but UV textures can be used to similar effect, albeit not quite so easily. In the  project paint buttons panel you'll find the "stencil" and "clone layer" buttons, which allow you to use different UV layers as masks or cloning sources when painting.
