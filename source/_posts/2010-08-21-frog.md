I like this little guy. Sculpted it today and painted the textures pretty much 90% in blenders texture paint mode. Usually I'd faff around in GIMP with lots of photos, but I was in the mood for some hand painting. I did use a couple of photo textures just as masks for painting over, but mainly it was done just with a regular round brush. As I'd had to do a retopo to recover from blender losing some of the multi-res data (oh the joys of development builds!) I had a nice low res baked mesh anyway, so I thought I'de render it in the Game engine. The image below is pretty much what I was getting in real time with the game engine, just with a litte DoF and bloom added in post.

Here is the high res sculpt (about 2.8M polys):

And a WIP shot of the texturing process:
