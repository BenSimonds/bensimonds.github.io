Hmm, maybe it was a power station, maybe a factory or a warehouse. All we know now is it's falling apart. A project I began a long time ago, which has been gathering dust on my hard drive, so I thought I'd post it up. At some point in the future I might resurrect it in its originally intended animated form, but for now here are some stills.

All the modelling was done in blender 2.49, with some sculpting and texturing in blender 2.5. Most of the texturing was done in GIMP, with a whole bunch of textures from [CGTextures.com](http://www.cgtextures.com/). Rendering was done in V-Ray, thanks to Andrey Izrantsev's fantastic [blender 2.49 to vray exporter](http://vray.cgdo.ru/) (though the newer 2.5 version is even better). Compositing was done in blender 2.5.
