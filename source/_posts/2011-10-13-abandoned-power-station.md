> Dude awesome!  amazing texture job!  The blender screenshots really show how you (intelligently) didn't go overboard with polys but instead got incredible detail with the textures.  Out of curiosity, did you use some from a site like cg textures, or go a different route?

> now THIS should be submitted for use on the call for Screenshots!  awesome detail.. I really love the overall feel of the environment.  Well done... you should really put this on Blenderartists.org in finished works.

> Light cache and irradiance map, though for some I only did irradiance. Mainly though I used both, along with vray sun lighting combined with some extra lamps.

> Very well done. Looks amazing. How many hours did you put into this?

> Great work, love it. You might work on the normalmaps and make the bloom from the window and the DOF a bit less prominent and it would be even greater. Keep it up :)

> *drools* Freshly fantastic, Ben! I could not see anything to critique about (for improvement), everything my eyes could lay on is just flawless.  Very well done, Ben! Inspiring yet again.

> i love these renders.  out of curiosity, did you use brute force raytracing or the irradiance map / light cache engines?
