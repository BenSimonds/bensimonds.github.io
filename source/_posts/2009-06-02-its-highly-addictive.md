A bit of Futurama fanart, makes a nice wallpaper I reckon. Click for full size. [![](http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/5643/slurm.jpg)](http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/5643/slurm.jpg "ImageShack - Image And Video Hosting") Blender for modelling, Inkscape for the label design, Luxrender for rendering, GIMP for Postwork/Text. Back view, for laughs... [![](http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/7959/slurmback2c.jpg)](http://img30.imageshack.us/my.php?image=slurmback2c.jpg "ImageShack - Image And Video Hosting")
