> This is what we need more of!   There are tons of repeated tutorials out there on "the blender side of things", but very little info creating textures with gimp/photoshop etc.   So often I see tutorials hit everything in detail except the actual creation of the textures.   This is the part I've been hazy on for so long.  I'd love to see more tips and tricks in this realm.   Thanks Ben!

> For future texture tutorials I'd love to see:
> 1. Painting human textures/soft surface textureing
> 2. Hard surface texturing
> 3. Hand painting textures from scratch (No photo textures)
> 4. Tips and Tricks that are out of left field that I would not even know to think about.

> Regarding transitions section: how exactly do you obtain that "Grungy Transition"? Do you start from hard black-white transition and paint on the edge with the grungy brush? In this case do you need special brush that paints in "both directions" (black-on white and white -on black)? My problem is that all brushes I found (on Deviant Arts etc.) are single color with transparency, so my transitions paint only with foreground color. Where to find suitable brushes? Or is there some special trick in Gimp that makes it possible to use standard single-color brush to paint both ways as you are showing in your "Grungy Transition" example?

> I just do a bit of painting in both directions. Fist with the foreground colour set to white, then to black.
