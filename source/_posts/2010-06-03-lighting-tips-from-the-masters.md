> Ben, you did it again! This is very valuable information.  Thanks for sharing it. ^_^

Heho (Jun 06, 2010)
> Nice Tutorial, learnt a lot. But i've got a question: When I have a dark lighting setup there are often some strange lighting artifacts visible. They don't really fade from light to dark but they look like "steps"(I'm sorry that i can't describe it better... English is not my native tangue). This can't be a buffer problem cause it is also there when I only use Raytracing... You can see what I mean here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/de/c/ca/Blender3D_li_inv_square.jpg look at the light on the floor... It's like there aren't enough RGB colors to create a smoothe gradient...
> So how I get rid of this? One possible way is to activate dither but this let the picture look like a bad jpeg...

bensimonds (Jun 06, 2010)
> Hmm. A certain amount of banding is inevitable, especially if you're going to save in an 8-bit format. I'm afraid I can't really see what's going on in that image - it's rather dark, and being a jpeg I cant tell whether any artefact is compression or something from blender. It looks reasonably smooth to me though.

bensimonds (Jun 06, 2010)
> Just a thought, are you compositing in GIMP or doing a composite with an image saved in an 8 bit format? If so it could be that - always save to a 16bit or better format if you're going to be doing any kind of levels adjustment to an image (which gimp won't open.... that's another issue though).

Heho (Jun 06, 2010)
> I thought that this has no influence on the render itself... Anyway: Which formats should I choose? And why are those bandings even in the default render visible?
> BTW: I always composite in Blender.

Heho (Jun 06, 2010)
> I just noticed(when I looked closer at the picture) that the bandings are really just the nearest colors(that means: band one R:0.111 G:0.111 B:0.111 band two R:0.112 G:0.112 B: 0.112 you get it) But this should not be noticeable for the human eye...

bensimonds (Jun 06, 2010)
> I really can't see much banding on the image you posted. Are you sure your monitors brightness and contrast are set correctly? This could well be the issue.

Oscar Baechler (Jun 05, 2010)
> ZOMG I love you for Bouguereau examples. Best painter people have never heard of!

bensimonds (Jun 05, 2010)
> Absolutely. Bouguerau was the master - probably my favourite painter, although that's probably a three way tie between him, Leighton and Ingres.

Saurav (Feb 24, 2011)
> Thanks Man and You Rock the Blender.

> Hello Ben, 
> 
> First I must point out I'm new to 3D rendering &amp; animation. Just read your tutorial and found it very informative and easy to understand. However, would you use a three point lighting setup for a dynamic outdoor animation (Would you have to constrain lights to model?) or is it only used for static images?

Ben Simonds (Aug 05, 2013)
> You could light an outdoor scene this way, particularly if you were focussing on a single model or character within the scene - you could apply some basic lighting to the main areas of the scene in one render pass and light the main subject with a three point setup in another.
> 
> However for simplicity I'd suggest going for a GI setup with a sun lamp for outdoor lighting, it's easier to make things look physically correct this way.

FCDIF (Jun 07, 2013)
> A nice thing it's very cool. Thank...

Robert Cunningham (Apr 21, 2013)
> The artifacts look like an optical illusion. Your mind makes the banding because of the objects. You project the lines automatically. Look at the picture from a different angle and they disappear.
