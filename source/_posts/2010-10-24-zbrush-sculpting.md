Getting my head around all the brushes and features that zbrush has to offer. It's a pretty incredible program. I did this one with the aid of some videos by [Ryan Kingslien](http://twitter.com/#!/ryankingslien) in this months 3D world mag, which were pretty invaluable in working out what brushes were useful for what, as we'll as his fantastic anatomy knowledge. (Plus, Sintel is [on the cover](http://www.blendernation.com/2010/09/21/sintel-on-3d-worlds-october-issue/), so even blender purists will have something to please them).
