I participated in the current CGSoc Hardcore Modelling Challenge, in which the aim was to create a single model and then create 15 different expressions on that model. I used Rowan Atkinson as a reference, and whilst the resulting likeness isn't 100%, I'm happy with the range of expressions in the results. [![RowanEx4](/images/old/rowanex4.jpg)](/images/old/rowanex4.jpg) [![RowanExpressionsComp](/images/old/rowanexpressionscomp.jpg)](/images/old/rowanexpressionscomp.jpg) And here is a video of the model morphing between the expressions (Click to visit vimeo for correct aspect ratio and larger size):
