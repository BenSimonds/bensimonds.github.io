[![](/images/old/elf_finished.jpg)](/images/old/elf_finished.jpg) I made this guy for a tutorial on blendercookie.com. The tutorial covers baking textures in blender from a high poly sculpt to a lower resolution mesh for rendering , then painting textures in GIMP, and using them to create a three-layer node based skin shader in blender. Part one covers the baking and texure painting, and is up on BlenderCookie already. The next part will cover setting up the materials and rendering, and should be up on BlenderCookie soon. [Part I: Texture Baking in Blender and Painting in GIMP](http://www.blendercookie.com/2011/05/23/texturing-and-rendering-an-elf-head-in-blender-part-01/) [Part II: Skin shading and rendering in Blender](http://www.blendercookie.com/2011/06/01/texturing-and-rendering-an-elf-head-in-blender-part-02/) I also recorded a timelapse of the modelling and sculpting process. About 95% of the sculpting process is covered here, and all of the modelling - I did some final tweaks later on that I forgot to record. [vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/24375883 w=580&h=363]
