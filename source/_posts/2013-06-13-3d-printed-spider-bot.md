[![Spider2 ><](/images/old/spider2.jpg?w=950)](/images/old/spider2.jpg)

This guy just arrived at the office. I think he's looking pretty cool. If you haven't seen him before, he's one of the projects in my book, [Blender Master Class](http://bensimonds.com/2013/01/04/blender-master-class-a-hands-on-guide-to-modeling-sculpting-materials-and-rendering/). The book covers making him in blender, through the processes of modeling, sculpting, and texturing, then creating materials and rendering with the cycles render engine. With the book finished I thought I'd get him 3D printed as a bit of a momento. I made some modifications to the model to make it more suitable for 3D printing, and sent the model files off to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) to be printed. I'll document the process soon in another post, but for now I just wanted to put up a few pictures. Also, if you want one of your own, [you can find it on the Gecko Shapeways store](http://www.shapeways.com/model/1123311/spiderbot-from-blender-master-class.html).

Edit: Reavenk pointed out in the comments that it would be good to see it next to an everyday object to get a sense of scale. Here he is along side his digital counterpart, perched atop the book.

> Pretty cool! There needs to be a pic with it next to an everyday object so we can get scale. Is it all one solid piece or does anything articulate?
