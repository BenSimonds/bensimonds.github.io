> Animating the flow of time would look awesome. Even better: having someone who can impersonate the Guide's VO to narrate it.

> PS: You might want to send this to ZZ9PluralZAlpha, which is the Hitchhiker's fanclub. The people there would love this.

> Have you thought about making a book version of the timeline as well?  This is awesome, but I've never listened to the radio series..  Although, now I think I'm going to go dig it up and give it a listen..

> Looking this over, it looks like the timelines are very close..  Closer than I would have thought..  Probably wouldn't take to much..

> Hi Ben, I'm just curious how'd you make that in blender?

> Just curves and text objects mostly. The arrowheads are just cone meshes.
