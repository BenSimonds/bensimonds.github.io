This is just a quick little video tutorial to test out my new screen recording setup and to show off how to use GIMP's resynthesize plugin. One thing to note that I thought of afterwards: using a harder selection gives slightly better results than the soft selection I used. Just use a harder brush or select the areas with the lasso tool. Recorded using Nathan Vegdahl's handy [record screen.py](http://www.davidrevoy.com/index.php?article65/recordscreen-py-video-and-audio-capture-for-linux-with-ffmpeg) script. If your version of GIMP doesn't come with the plugin pre-installed, you can find it in Ubuntu's package browser, or download linux and windows versions from:[ http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer](http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer)
