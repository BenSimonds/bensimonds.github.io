> Have you try sculptris?

> I have, it used to run nicely under wine and I had fun using it, it seems like a great program for more sketchy sculpts where you aren't sure of the forms you want yet. I like having subdivision levels for most sculpting though. It makes for much more non-destructive sculpting.

> Its great..! I tried sculpting...but i am not able to import brushes using the User preferences, as the brush option is not available in the import panel. May i know how to solve this problem...please?  I have the latest version of blender installed (Blender 2.59.0 r39307).

> You append brushes like you would any other kind of data from another blend file, via file &gt; append and selecting the blend file with your brushes in and selecting them from there.
