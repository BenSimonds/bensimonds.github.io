> last year for my final project at collage I did a a script that watches a folder for any .txt called “RenderList”, if this file is found the script lunches blender to render the files written in the txt file. The cool thing is that you can use Dropbox to upload a .blend file and if the output folder is also shared in DropBox you can see the rendering almost in "realtime". It was a pretty good life saver since I was working at home (bad PC) and rendering at work  (good PC) in the night!
