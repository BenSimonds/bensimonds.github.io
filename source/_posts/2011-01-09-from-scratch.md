This was a fun little exercise in building a face/head from the ground up. Starting with the skull, then placing the muscles and cartilage, and finally to skin. I learned a lot from it actually, as doing things this way illuminates a lot of little subtlties in how the face is constructed and why certain parts look the way they do. I'll have to do more of it in future.
