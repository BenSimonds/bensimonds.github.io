I've been trying to replicate some of the brushes I've been using a lot in zbrush in blender, in particular the rake brush, which I find very useful. Here are three brushes as well as some extra alphas to try with them (or whichever other sculpting app you use). Included are: 

  * A rake brush, great for refining forms (see for examples).﻿
  * A rasp brush, basically a textured scrape brush that removes material and adds a fine texture to the surface.﻿﻿
  * A slash brush that scrapes wrinkles/scratches into the surface. Use it softly to create a base for wrinkles, or scrape harder to Create rough, rocky surfaces.

You can download the brushes from [Blendswap.com](http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/brushes/bens-sculpt-brushes/). And here are some rake alphas I made: [](/images/old/rakealpha2.jpg

> Just append them into the default blend file and then save it as your new startup file (Ctrl-U).

> Appending them isn't working, I can't find any videos on the matter, and every time I search, I get the same thing and NONE OF IT IS WORKING.

> Can someone please make a video explaining how to import custom brushes for sculpting?
