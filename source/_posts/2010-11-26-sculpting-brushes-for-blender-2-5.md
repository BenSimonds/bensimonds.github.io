I've been trying to replicate some of the brushes I've been using a lot in zbrush in blender, in particular the rake brush, which I find very useful. Here are three brushes as well as some extra alphas to try with them (or whichever other sculpting app you use). Included are: 

  * A rake brush, great for refining forms (see for examples).﻿
  * A rasp brush, basically a textured scrape brush that removes material and adds a fine texture to the surface.﻿﻿
  * A slash brush that scrapes wrinkles/scratches into the surface. Use it softly to create a base for wrinkles, or scrape harder to Create rough, rocky surfaces.

You can download the brushes from [Blendswap.com](http://www.blendswap.com/3D-models/brushes/bens-sculpt-brushes/). And here are some rake alphas I made: [](/images/old/rakealpha2.jpg
