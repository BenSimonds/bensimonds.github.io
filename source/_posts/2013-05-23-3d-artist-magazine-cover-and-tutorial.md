[This months 3D Artist magazine](http://www.3dartistonline.com/news/2013/05/3d-artist-issue-55-out-today/) is a Blender special issue, featuring lots of blender related tutorials and articles. I had the pleasure of working on an image for the cover of the magazine, that is also featured in a 17-step tutorial inside. In the tutorial I go through modeling and textuing the jet, creating materials for rendering in cycles, and creating a final scene using linked libraries and multiple scenes with smoke and explosions. ![](http://www.3dartistonline.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3D-Artist-issue-55-Blender-tutorial.jpg) You can also find a full-page review of blender master class as well as a small Q&A section about [Gecko Animation](http://www.geckoanimation.com/) in the magazine. There's also a bunch of other cool content and tutorials, including tips and tricks from the Tears of Steel crew, and a load of textures and resources on the disc that comes with the magazine.
