Jan-Willem van Dronkelaar's head sculpting presentation was excelent, in particular he had a few great anatomy tips for the face that I want to apply in some studies when I get home.

The sintel animators gave some great tips for working on animations in blender, and talked about their experiences on the film. The lengths they went to, to get the hair simulation working and baked to their liking were incredible. They also explained the system of proxies they used in character animation. 

Soenke gave some nice tips on faking lighting with blend textures.
