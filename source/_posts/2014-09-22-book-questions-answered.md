> A short video on how to model the foot ;) I think it was like the hand but I don't know how to get a 3 side face in the middle of the foot, in the book picture looks like this helps to make an edge loop in the toe

> Hey Ben, in chapter 4 when you talk about bloacking in the vines for the Jungle Temple. I couldn't figure out how you made your vines a circle. I could only get a incomplete circle. Would you please tell me how to do it right. Thank you!

> Hello there, first of all, a huge thanks for making Blender Master Class! I am new to Blender and I found this book as a great source of tons of useful information.
> Here is my question, or more like a request: I was able to model out the base mesh for Bat creature without any serious complications, but now i am at the sculpting part and I am just completely lost :D My sculpting just doesnt look any near to yours, maybe I am just lame or stupid, but could you maybe make just some short example video of scultping a certain part, like abdomens or chest? I was able to get thru the "Volumes" and "Landmarks" stages, but I am just not certain how to make those final steps.. Thanks for any kind of a reply :D
