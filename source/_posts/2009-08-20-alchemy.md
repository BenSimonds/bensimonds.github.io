I came across [Alchemy](http://al.chemy.org/) while watching David Leroy's fantastic [speedpainting video](http://www.vimeo.com/6143607) of a piece of [Durian](http://durian.blender.org/) concept art. It's a really nice way of generating some chaos to help inspire your drawing. The interface is mininmalistic and intuitive, and to tools create some really interesting shapes whilst also allowing a decent amount of control for once you want to start picking out specific forms. I'm not the greatest painter, but I think I managed some interesting results, starting with alchemy and then moving to GIMP to do the main part of the painting.
