> Thanks ScaroDJ, I've put a note in the post about this. Basically in older builds simple child particles used the option "particles", and interpolated particles were labelled "faces". They work the same, but the names have changed (I think they make more sense now).

> Awesome article! I've already played around with hair and don't get me wrong, it CAN be fun even if you have no idea what you're doing, but with the workflow you describe and all the tips you give I know I can start taking hair seriously. Fantastic stuff!

Connor (Jun 29, 2011)
> How do you get the hair to not just go through the mesh instead actually manuevering the way you want it to?

Ben Simonds (Jun 29, 2011)
> Make sure you have Deflect Emitter turned on in the brush settings.

Connor (Jul 10, 2011)
> ...Let's say I wanted to use hair dynamics for a simulation, i got the hair to bend properly, and it also has enough air under it, but when i start it on the time line it slowly sinks through the head again

Ben Simonds (Jul 11, 2011)
> You can adjust the weighting on the hair for soft body simulation in particle mode with the weight tool. Weighting the parts that are sinking more heavily should make them stiffer and keep them from sinking.

> hair is the best part of human, that's make a difference between one model with another, and very hard part of modelling, i've spend 4-5 hours to make the hair, and it still not enough to make the model looks like what u want.haha
> i just wanna ask something, do you know how to insert the hair particles to unity 3d game engine? cause, everytime i insert my model, he's going to be a bald, the hair isn't exist, do you know how to fix it, someone was said if i change the particles to the mesh, it will be fine, but isn't work
> sorry for my bad english

Ben Simonds (Aug 13, 2011)
> I'm not familiar with unity, but I presume it requires hair be geometry based. If I recall correctly this might be a good tut on that topic: http://www.paultosca.com/varga_hair.html

electricalchimpanzeelearnstogeek (Aug 13, 2011)
> nice, thank u very much sir :)

Jess (Sep 04, 2011)
> is there a way to select several particle systems in particle mode at once? I'm trying to put highlights and darker strands in my model's hair using a seperate particle systems and it's proving to be a pain. Or, alternatively, is there a way to add highlights to one particle system?

Ben Simonds (Sep 05, 2011)
> If your hair emitter has UV co-ordinates, then you can use a texture to define the hair emission colour.

Jess (Sep 11, 2011)
> Cool, I think I got it. Thanks :D

Ben Simonds (Jan 25, 2012)
> Too many particles maybe. Depends on a lot of things. If you machine can't handle it that would be a good guess.

Ben Simonds (Apr 26, 2013)
> I don't think there is unfortunately. This one of the reasons to use a separate mesh for hair, and also to make sure you apply any deformations before working on a hair particle system.

shalini (Apr 26, 2013)
> Hi, I have a doubt, i've a model and created hair on the same mesh using particle, i have also completed the UV and texturing for it and now I got to give the model for rigging, but before rigging i want to freeze translate the mesh values, but now when i give freeze translation- the hair particle on the face mesh is changing... IS THERE ANY OPTION OR ANY METHOD TO AVOID THIS CHANGE ON THE HAIR ?????

Ben Simonds (Mar 18, 2013)
> If you're using a hair cap or something similar, make sure this gets parented to your head mesh/rig.

Glenn Wolf (Aug 27, 2013)
> hi.
> Got your book, it’s excellent. i’m having issues w/ hair though : i’m trying to do a girlie w/ long hair, but when i’m combing the hair over and down my scalp mesh i can’t stop it going inside the mesh, leaving a bald look. i’ve tried setting the Deflect Emitter etc, but that didn’t seem to help. i tried upping the number of Steps too, thinking maybe the segments were too long to make a decent curve, but that didn’t seem to help much either. as for other stuff, like setting the gravity that i saw in another tute, the hair just totally fell through and didn’t seem to register the scalp mesh at all.
> i was wanting to do some simple animations but i’m wondering if i should just sculpt and rig the hair instead :-/
