This is now my blog/portfolio where I'll post the 3d work I've been doing lately, and maybe the odd resource/tutorial once in a while. Over time it will hopefully become a groovy and interesting place. In the mean time I'm happy if someone just thinks it's cool and leaves a comment.

> I really like your website, got linked to it from the blendernation links page. I really like your style, I'm really trying to learn Blender, but it has a pretty steep learning curve. Did you use any books or anything to really help you get started using it? I like your level of detail you use in your models, and aspire to use the same level of detail in my own once i become good enough.

> I never used any books when I was starting blender, but that's not to say I advocate that approach. There's a wiki called Blender: Noob to Pro that was a great guide for starting out with blender, but I'm not sure how up to date it is nowadays. A better bet would be the blenducation.org site I think. I've not used it much myself yet but it seems to have some excellent beginner material. Also just post your WIPs on the BlenderArtists forums - everyone is pretty friendly there, and you'll get good suggestions on how to improve.
