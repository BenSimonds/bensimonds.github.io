> Thanks, very usefull.

bensimonds (Sep 18, 2010)
> I've come across this too it's an aliasing issue with the black pixels around the edges.  It's very simple to fix, just set the size of the texture to 0.98 in all directions to crop away the outermost pixels. I'd update the blend to fix it, but blendswap doesn't seem to have the capability to upload new versions.

> Alright, awesome, man, I'll check out the fix!  Hopefully a better solution (alpha) will be introduced in the future.

> Very awesome, man!  The matcap has some bad black artifacts around the edges, especially if you have a lot of tiny details.  But it's better than modeling with the standard material, so, thanks!

7 Blender Features All Beginners Need to Know | Regus Ttef (Sep 02, 2014)
> [&#8230;] Matcaps are perfect for sculpting and previewing you’re mesh in a render-like preview. To use them Press N to bring up the properties panel and scroll down to the “shading” tab and click “Matcap” then click on the Matcap and there will be a list of 24 unique Matcaps. Currently there is not a way to show custom Matcaps. But there is a workaround that allows you to. Ben Simonds explains how to do so Here [&#8230;]

> @vxc, back in 2007 I was seeking at giving some bits of volume at greater frame rate into flash 8... This demo showed you could even fake light direction using same principle. http://www.closier.nl/playground/phongscene_v2.html

> Awesome work but I have trouble using it. Could you please elaborate on "To use them, just create a shadeless material for your model and then add the image as a texture mapped to the materials normal co-ordinates."? What modes should I use for it, Blender Render with nodes? Could not set it up at all. I am using 2.76. Thanks!

> I dont understand, how come none ever thought about that spherical/normal mapping before
> althought it's fake material, it gives such great results with a simple SEM shader
