Here you can find my current add-ons for blender. 

# Randomiser:

Randomiser is an add-on for manipulating text and object data with blender. You can use it to cycle an objects data through multiple different meshes for example, or to create a whole variety of effects with text objects, such as a scrolling ticker readout, a typewriter effect, and random, noisy text.

# MultiQuicktime:

MultiQuicktime is a Blender add-on that lets you export multiple quicktime files from within blender's interface. It uses qt_tools for encoding videos, along with FFMPEG for some other more specific tasks. If I ever get around to it I might look at shifting the whole add-on over to using FFMPEG in order to make it more cross-platform. For now I assume it only works on OSX.
