> This is really interesting. 
> with physical making so much  sense, I would wonder where the exposure time, and the film ISO could fit in. I know there is a film exposure parameter, yet I'm not quite sure how it works and so far if you can find some kind a match with ISO, you would still need an aperture speed settings. I don't know if this is possible.

> I've had a go at adapting this by increasing the aperture of the box and fitting a simple single element glass lens to the front thus making a simple box camera. The results were as one would expect. Next going to try re-creating my Symmar-s lens!

> Would be interested in trying to create a laser light. Creating the mirrors, the light, and then then pinhole... could be another interesting project

> This is fantastic, I loved pinhole cameras when they were taking pictures of model railroads.
>   They looked so real. This is a really great experiment. Pushing Blender beyond the "box" ( of normal ).

> Maybe try it in Lux and Yafaray - might be interesting

Wasa (Mar 05, 2013)
> You should be able to adjust exposure instead of relying on really bright lighting.
> It's also more physically accurate since pinhole cameras take much much longer exposure time in comparison to a standard camera.

David Hiestand (Mar 05, 2013)
> Very interesting experiment.  Did any hint of a diffraction pattern occur?

Francois Tarlier (Mar 05, 2013)
> yeah my point exactly ! 
> Having so real life unit as aperture speed and ISO would make things easier. Also to try to match a real shoot for compositing.

David Hiestand (Mar 05, 2013)
> Hmmm.  Now that I've thought about it, there shouldn't be any diffraction pattern.  A ray is ray not a wave.

> Of all the cycles experiments I've seen, this is hands down the best and most fun!  Oddly one of my kids brought a pin hole camera they made a school yesterday

> Bravo.

> Yes, very impressive.  I'm amazed at what Cycles can do in terms of physical optics.  I had a go at this experiment, and also tried a large aperture with a lens (modified sphere with Glass shader).  I had to crank up the lights to absurd values, and set samples to something like 1000 - but my CPU overheated!

> [&#8230;] Recently, 3D artistÂ Ben Simonds recreated the pinhole camera, or &#8220;camera obscura&#8221; experiment completely in Blender. The results of this little test may not look all that interesting, but the physics it demonstrates are reality-based. Definitely check out his results here. [&#8230;]
