> Cool, gonna give this a go. At least could save doing the whole 'open image sequence and resave' rigmarole. Cheers.

> All installed ok, but when I click the configure button, nothing happens. Not sure what could be going wrong. I'm on 10.7.5 and Blender 2.69 (with a 3/12/13 nightly build atm)

> I installed the qt_tools and built an applescript app to export a batch of files to a QT setting plist using xgrid in snow leopard server. Several cores work on the batch from many macs. All files get exported and logs get written. If you're interested hit me up.
