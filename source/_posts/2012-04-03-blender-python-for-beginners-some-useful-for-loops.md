> Nice tips :) I've recently (yesterday) started learning python too - really a great tool for artists.
> As for the last one regarding bundle sizes for the camera tracker, you can just change that in the N properties bar :) and change their type there too.
> I think I'm gonna find the subsurf one and the obj index one invaluable :) thanks!
