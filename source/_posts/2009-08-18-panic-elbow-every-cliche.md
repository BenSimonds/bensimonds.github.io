Another piece of cover art I did for a friends band: Panic Elbow. Made with blender and the Gimp. The album isn't out yet but I wanted to show it off. In the meantime you can check out their current music on the band's [myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/panicelbow), check them out!

I also did them an [EP cover](http://bensimonds.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/panic-elbow-ep-cover/) a while back.
