I created a couple of base meshes recently to give me something to start with when sculpting heads and bodies. I thought I'd make them avaliable. I've also included a GLSL matcap material I created that works quite well for sculpting. You're free to use them for whatever you want. If you just want the matcap you can download the image directly to use in whatever application you prefer. Here's a sculpt I made with the bust basemesh:
