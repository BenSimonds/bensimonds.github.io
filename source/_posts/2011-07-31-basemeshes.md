> How did you do the hair? I know it's sculpted, but how did you start it out?

Ben Simonds (Aug 13, 2011)
> I did the hair with zbrushes zpheres tools, but you could do the same thing by retopologising the general shape of the hair over the skull and then sculpting.

> Thanks. I'm working on a sculpt and that looks like a good hairstyle for him.

> Thanks for the model!
> There is something puzzling. When I edit the model in Edit Mode it always stays symmetrical even though there is not mirror modifier or any symmetry I can identify. How are you doing this? :)
