> That's a great tip for combining the two images.
> I created a pretty cool off-axis camera rig that avoids vertical parallax, I will be posting that soon. With this the anaglyph thing will be complete :)

> Sounds cool. Leave a comment when it's done!

> World of thanks to you for this!  I've been wanting to do a 3D version of the movie that I've been creating these past few years.

> I fetched one of the 3D glasses that we've kept around the house to see if they would work with the image you placed here.  It did.  Now, I wish that you were able to offer us a short video sample.

> I referred to the image of the male bust.  I just noticed the gun and animated gif reference.  I loaded the gif and watched the the 3D glasses.  I could still see the red and blue.

Also, as I recall from viewing the classic 3D movies many years ago when I took my glasses off the scenes appeared blurry.  I think, 3 cameras were used back in the day.  Maybe, if we try using a 3 camera technique we might find a way to get more of the 3D effect?  Perhaps, soften (Blur?) the red and blue channels?

> Just a thought.  Anyhow, I still appreciate the info in your post.  It has inspired me to experiment.  If you get the jump on me to experiment with what I've suggested, please post your results.

> I'm afraid to say I think you've got the wrong end of the stick there. For one, there is no such thing as a yellow channel, and secondly only two cameras are necessary, as humans only have two eyes - one camera for each. As far as the blur - this occurs because you are looking at two images from different viewpoints combined together, no actual blurring of either image is being done, this would only degrade their quality.

> One thing that can improve the effect is careful mixing of the red channel with a greyscale copy of the other channels to improve the contrast of that layer before combining the two images to make an anaglyph.

> You've probably got low quality glasses? Here the gun has a terrific stereo effect and no red/blue ghosts are visible. Are you sure you're using left-red right-cyan glasses and not flipped or red/green ones?

> Nice work. You have some great results there.
